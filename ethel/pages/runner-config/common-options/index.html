  </ul>

  <p id="retry-policy" class="subtitle is-5 docs-subhead">Error handling and retry</p>
  <p>By default, when a runner hits an error it records the error message and stops processing the task, setting it's
    status to suspended. You can then manually restart the task via the client or API.</p>
  <p>By adding a retry policy to a runner this behaviour can be changed to automatically retry the task. Retries can be
    configured to control the number of retries, the delay between the retries and what error messages would not be
    retried. This configuration option is available for all runners.</p>
  <p>This simplest retry policy is to set a number of retry attempts. There will be a five second delay between each
    retry by default. An example of this with two retry attempts:</p>
  <pre>
  {
    ...
    "retry": {
      "limit": 2
    }
  }
  </pre>
  <p>You can also specify a different amount of delay, as well as the ability to increase the delay between each retry.
    The delay is specified in milliseconds.</p>
  <pre>
  {
    ...
    "retry": {
      "limit": 2,
      "delay": 10000,
      "pattern": "backoff"
    }
  }
  </pre>
  <p>In addition to changing the number of retries and the delay between retries you can also specify specific error
    messages that will not be retried as well as other messages that will automatically add the item to a quarantine if
    that option was available on the extractor.</p>
  <pre>
  {
    ...
    "retry": {
      "limit": 2,
      "delay": 10000,
      "pattern": "backoff",
      "noRetryMessages": [
        "System is unavailable"
      ], 
      "quarantineMessages": [
        "Item already exists"
      ]
    }
  }
  </pre>

  <p id="queues" class="subtitle is-5 docs-subhead">Runner queues</p>
  <p>By default all tasks are sent to a message queue called <i>tasks</i>. And again, by default, all queue services
    will start up a listener for the <i>tasks</i> queue. This configuration is available for all runners.</p>
  <p>In some situations you may want a runner to use an alternative queue or configure a core instance or the
    ethel-agent to listen on queues other than <i>tasks</i>.</p>
  <p>One example would be a job working with Personal Storage Table (.pst) files. There are a number of .NET libraries
    for managing pst files, but no support in Node.js. You would then create a .NET runner for the ethel-agent and have
    that listen to the <i>mail</i> queue. Then in the job configuration you would nominate the runner to use the
    <i>mail</i> queue rather than the default <i>tasks</i> queue.
  </p>
  <pre>
  {
    "type": "PSTLoader",
    "config": {
      ...
    },
    "queue": "mail"
  }
  </pre>
  <p>And then for the ethel-agent configuration you would add change the default ETHEL_QUEUE environment variable:</p>
  <pre>ETHEL_QUEUE={"type":"RabbitMQ","url":"aqmps://server.tld:15672","queues":['mail']}</pre>

  <p id="batches" class="subtitle is-5 docs-subhead">Batches</p>
  <p>Most runners provide the option to split a large job into multiple batches. This can be useful when multiple
    different run types are being processed and a very large run will block the queue from processing other smaller
    runs.
  </p>
  <p>To set up batches the config will require two elements, the batch size and a hash name. The batch size determines
    how many tasks the extractor will generate in each run before stopping and the hash name is needed to stop
    extracting the same information each time a new batch is run. An example config is:</p>
  <pre>
  {
    "type": "FileSystemExtractor",
    "config": {
      ...
      "hashName": "DevHRMigration",
      "batchSize": 500,
      ...
    }
  }
  </pre>
  <p>Another scenario where this may be useful is having a second instance of ethel core processing smaller, less
    frequent runs that may take a while to be processed in the main <i>tasks</i> queue.</p>

  <p id="repeating-runs" class="subtitle is-5 docs-subhead">Repeating runs</p>
  <p>Multiple runners provide the ability to repeat the extract stage and ignore unchanged data. To allow this to happen
    the configuration section requires a hashName. The hashName will be used to store a value as a lookup that is used
    to compare the data on later runs to see if it has changed.</p>
  <p>The lookup and is made up of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>name - the hashName supplied in the runner config</li>
    <li>key - a unique identifier to the piece of data</li>
    <li>value - the value used to compare if the item has changed between runs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each runner will generate the value used for the comparison based on the data structures of the extract system. For
    example the FileSystemExtractor generates these values with the following logic:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>name - the hashName supplied in the runner config</li>
    <li>key - a hash of the path to the file or directory</li>
    <li>value - a hash of an object with the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>size - the file size in bytes</li>
        <li>mtimeMs - the time the file was last modified</li>
        <li>birthtimeMs - the time the file was created</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To support the ability to ignore unchanged items in multiple runs add the following to the runner config:</p>
  <pre>
  {
    "config": {
        ...
      "hashName": "DevHRMigration",
    ...
    }
  }
  </pre>
  <p>As these values are lookups they can be reset by using the Settings section in the client. Find the lookups with
    the name specified and delete these lookups to reset the check.</p>

  <p id="quarantine" class="subtitle is-5 docs-subhead">Quarantine</p>
  <p>The quarantine functionality allows you to stop a particular item in the migration from being processed. This would
    be used when there's a problem that needs to be resolved before another attempt is made to process the item.</p>
  <p>Quarantining a task creates a lookup using the item identifier created by the extract runner and the quarantine
    name specified and uses the quarantine name supplied in the extractor configuration Once quarantined the item will
    be ignored until the quarantine lookup is deleted.</p>
  <p>Items can be quarantined two ways, via the client or via an error handling configuration. To quarantine an item in
    the client find the task that has the issue and click the Quarantine button in the task view or the Quarantine tasks
    view in the tasks view. Alternatively the error handling for a runner can be updated to automatically quarantine
    tasks that have a specific error message.</p>
  <p>An example extract configuration is:</p>
  <pre>
  {
    "config": {
        ...
      "quarantinedLookupName": "DevHRMigrationQuarantine",
    ...
    }
  }
  </pre>
  <p>An example error handling config for a runner is:</p>
  <pre>
  {
    "type": "OTCSLoader",
    "config": {
      ...
    },
    "retry": {
      "limit": 2,
      "quarantineMessages": [
        "Item already exists"
      ]
    }
  }
  </pre>

  <p id="ignore" class="subtitle is-5 docs-subhead">Ignoring items</p>
  <p>General ignore options are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>maxSize - ignore a item larger than a configured value</li>
    <li>minSize - ignore a item smaller than a configured value</li>
    <li>name - ignore an item that contains the specified string</li>
    <li>nameIgnoreCase - ignore an item that contains the specified string, ignoring case</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some runners may also provide extra ignored options. For example the OpenText Content Server extractor provides the
    ability to ignored specific object types. An example ignore configuration:</p>
  <pre>
    "config": {
      "ignore": {
        "minSize": 350,
        "name": ["system.ini","Superseded"],
        "nameIgnoreCase": ["drafts"]
      },
    }
  </pre>
  <p>The minSize and maxSize options do not have any unit of measure assumed. Supply the ignore value in the units
    that the system uses. For example, the FileSystemExtractor and CotnentServerExtractor runners both use bytes.</p>
  <p>The name option is case sensitive. For a case insensitive ignore use the nameIgnoreCase option.</p>

  <p id="text-replacement" class="subtitle is-5 docs-subhead">Text replacement</p>
  <p>Strings can be processed by the parseTemplateString function from the task-runner base class.
    This function will find all occurences of <code>${.*}</code> in the supplied text string.</p>
  <p>For each occurrence it will assume the value is in the message attribute of the task and will split the value by
    periods. It will then iterate through the segments to check if that attribute exists in the message object.</p>
  <p>For example the query <code>UPDATE status SET updated = '${MockLoaderCompleted}' WHERE id = '${item.id}'</code>
    will look for <code>this.task.message.MockLoaderCompleted</code> and <code>this.task.message.item.id</code> and
    replace these with the values of the attributes.</p>
