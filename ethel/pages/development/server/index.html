<h3 class="title is-3">ethel servers</h3>
<div class="content">

  <p>The ethel servers will come in two flavours. Currently only the server is available. These are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>server - this version contains all the server components</li>
    <li>worker - this version does not contain the runs service or api and can be configured to run just the tasks
      or system services</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="title is-4">Who's who in the ethel service zoo</h4>

  <p>The server has three main modules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>api - handles the REST API</li>
    <li>core - contains the services that manage the runs and tasks</li>
    <li>system - contains services for managing background tasks like monitoring, notifications, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The key module is the core module with the following services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>RunnersService - used by the task runners to communicate with the system</li>
    <li>RunsService - controls which run is running</li>
    <li>TasksService - monitors each queue and makes sure the queues are filled with waiting tasks</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="title is-4">Service communication</h4>

  <p>Most comunication in the system happens via events and message. There are three types of messages, run, queue and
    system messages. The events, the service that raises them and the services that listen to them are described below.
  </p>

  <p>Outside the events approach the RunnerService has the queues object injected by the TasksService at initiation. The
    RunnerService uses this to enqueue tasks with the relevant queue.</p>

  <table class="table is-fullwidth">

      <th>Listener</th>

        <td>TasksService</td>
        <td>The SystemController will emit a message if the client sends a request.<br>
          The RunsService will emit a message if a running run is suspeneded, stopped or deleted.<br> The change in run
          status can happen internally or via the client</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>queue - drained</td>
        <td>RunsService</td>
        <td>The TasksService will emit a message when a queue has no more tasks to process.</td>

        <td>RunsService</td>
        <td>The RunsController will emit a message when a new run is added via the API.<br>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>run - started</td>
        <td>TasksService</td>
        <td>The RunsService will emit a message when a run is started or restarted.</td>

        <td>RunsService<br>NotificationService</td>
        <td>The RunsController will emit a message when a run is suspended via the API.<br>
          The RunsService will emit a message when a new run has been inactive for 15 minutes.<br>
          The TasksService used to emit a message when a run had too many errors. This is currently disabled, but may
          return.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>run - restarted</td>
        <td>RunsService</td>
        <td>The RunsController will emit a message when a run is restarted via the API.<br>
          The TasksService will emit a message when a task error retry is due, if the run was suspended while waiting
          for the retry.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>run - stopped</td>
        <td>RunsService</td>
        <td>The RunsController will emit a message when a run is stopped via the API.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>run - completed</td>
        <td>NotificationService</td>
        <td>The RunsService will emit a message when a run is complete.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>run - deleted</td>
        <td>RunsService</td>
        <td>The RunsController will emit a message when a run is deleted via the API.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>system - shutdown</td>
        <td>SystemService</td>
        <td>The SystemController will emit a message when the client sends a request.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>system - updateRunData</td>
        <td>RunsService</td>
        <td>The SystemService schedules a job to emit this message very 10 minutes so that the run ETA is updated.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Most of these work well, but there is a problematic relationship that is generally involved in problems where ethel
    won't pick up and process the next task.</p>

  <p>In most cases it is because either the <strong>queue drained</strong> or <strong>run started</strong> message isn't
    being raised. It could either be because the RunsService doesn't know to check whether a run has been completed, or
    the TasksService doesn't know a queue is empty.<br>
    There's a bit of a chicken and egg problem when looking at these problems. The RunsService relies on receiving a
    <strong>queue drained</strong> message so that it can check if any running run is completed. This then allows it to
    emit the <strong>run started</strong> message that will prompt the TasksService to enqueue tasks with the
    appropriate queue. So look at whether these two events are being raised at the right time.
  </p>

  <p>I suspect there are still edge cases that aren't being handled so one of TasksService or RunsService just sits
    doing nothing waiting for the other service to tell them to do something.<br>To work around these edge cases,
    background checkers maybe added to these two services to try send the appropriate message if it wasn't sent as part
    of the standard processing.</p>
